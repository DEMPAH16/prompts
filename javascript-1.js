// ------------------------------------------- 0 -------------------------------- //
// make a variable called `name`
// on another line, set it to your name


// create a function called `shout`
// in that function, it will `console.log` the input into the function



// pass your name into the function you made
// if it outputs your name in all caps, you're good to go on









// ------------------------------------------- 1 -------------------------------- //
// now make another variable called `num` and set it to any number you choose




// create a function called `add` that takes in two numbers
// output from it those two numbers added together



// create another function called `add5` that only accepts one number
// output from it the result of `add` passing in the passed-in number and 5







// console.log the output of `add5` called with your number
// as long as it's your number plus 5, you're good to continue








// ------------------------------------------- 2 -------------------------------- //
// make another variable called `arr`
// assign an array to it with all kinds of values, and as many as you want




// console.log the length of the array (not by counting it yourself, use the special property on it)





// log out the type of the first index of the array
// * EXTRA CREDIT * use a javascript keyword to get the type instead of explicitly saying it
